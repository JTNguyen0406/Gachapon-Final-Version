# Gachapon-Final-Version

For my project, I built a gachapon machine. 
To briefly explain what is and use of gachapon, gachapons are like randomized vending machines. 
You insert a coin and crank a knob to get a prize. 
These machines have small trinkets, such as keychains, or small figurines, and are of a specific series. From food to popular series, you see these machines throughout Japan, and even sometimes around Japanese supermarkets in the U.S..
There is an incentive to "collect them all," but you aren't guaranteed what you want. 
These gachapon machines even sparked an influence in a genre of mobile gaming. "Gacha games" are games in which you spend a currency you can obtain throughout the game (or real money), to "pull" for a certain digital item, such as a character, amongst many others. 
These gacha games are very profitable and are serious business. "Honkai: Star Rail," a popular gacha game, made $145,000,000 globally in March 2024, from people using real money to "pull."
To transition back to the project, the machine is meant to emulate using a gachapon. There is a prize pool (the sushi keychains), each varying in rarity: common, rare, and epic. You insert a coin and get a reward. There are 9 different prizes, and the user can "pull" for those rewards up to 30 times before the inventory runs out. When the inventory runs dry, the program stops. 
The program hits all the beats needed for someone (or me) to make their own gacha game. Many more features could be added. For example, a "pity" system (Guaranteed to get a high rarity item if the user can't get a high rarity item after a certain amount of pulls), amongst many others.
